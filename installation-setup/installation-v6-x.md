<li>Upload all of the files to the server, maintaining the folders as they are </li>
<li>Ensure that you have write permissions set for the following folders:
<ul>
<li><span class="filename">/ttfontdata/</span> </li>

<li><span class="filename">/graph_cache/</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To test the installation, point your browser to the example files folder e.g. <span class="filename">[path_to_mpdf_folder]/mpdf/examples/</span></p>
<p>If you wish to install additional fonts please see the notes in <a href="{{ "/fonts-languages/fonts-in-mpdf-5-x.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Fonts &amp; Languages</a> for further instructions.</p>

Upgrading from version mPDF 5.x</h2>
<p>mPDF 6 has changed significantly from earlier version and it is recommended that a fresh install is used. You may wish to copy your previous config_* files and use them to update the new config files.</p>
<p><b>config_fonts.php</b> - values of "indic" and "unAglyphs" from previous versions are now redundant.</p>
<p><b>config_lang2fonts.php</b> - this is similar to the previous config_cp.php file; note however that $unifont (NOT $unifonts) must be only one font (not a comma-separated list as before).</p>
<p><b>Included fonts</b> - the Indic fonts e.g. ind_bn_001.ttf are no longer required (nor do they work properly with mPDF 6).</p>
<p><b>useLang</b> - this configurable variable, which used to be true by default, is now redundant. You may need to set: $mpdf-&gt;autoLangToFont = true; for the same results.</p>
<p><b>SetAutoFont()</b> - is now redundant. You may need to set: $mpdf-&gt;autoScriptToLang = true; for the same results.</p>
<p><b>Indexes</b> - have been largely redefined. See the section above.</p>
<p><b>Lists</b> - have been rewritten. See the section above.</p>
<p><b>Headers and Footers</b> - have been rewritten. See the section above.</p>
<p>A number of old depracated aliases will no longer be supported. Warning errors have been added to prompt you to change to the updated form:</p>
<ul>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;useOddEven - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;mirrorMargins</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;useSubstitutionsMB - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;useSubstitutions</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;AliasNbPg - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;aliasNbPg</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;AliasNbPgGp - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;aliasNbPgGp</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;BiDirectional - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;biDirectional</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;Anchor2Bookmark - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;anchor2Bookmark</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;KeepColumns - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;keepColumns</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;UnvalidatedText - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;watermarkText</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;TopicIsUnvalidated - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;showWatermarkText</li>
<li>$mpdf-&gt;Reference - should now use - $mpdf-&gt;IndexEntry</li>
</ul>
<p>The following functions have been removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>setUnvalidatedText - should now use - SetWatermarkText() </li>
<li>AddPages - should now use - AddPage() or HTML code methods </li>
<li>startPageNums</li>
<li>CreateReference and CreateIndex - cf. Index section above</li>
</ul>
<h3>Default style sheet</h3>
<p>A new mpdf.css file includes defaults for LISTS top/bottom margins, and also examples for Indexes and ToCs. This now acts like a normal CSS file, including cascading selectors i.e. not just main tags. This is always read (if present), so acts as a secondary default CSS, but one which allows selectors. Styles added to this act like a user stylesheet when considering precedence e.g. cellSpacing and border-spacing.</p>
<h3>Direct writing methods and OTL</h3>
<p>WriteText() WriteCell() Watermark() AutoSizeText() and ShadedBox() DO support complex scripts and right-to-left text (RTL).</p>
<p>Write() does NOT support complex scripts or RTL (NB this is a change - Write() used to support RTL).</p>
<p>CircularText() does NOT support complex scripts or RTL.</p>
<p>MultiCell() DOES support complex scripts and RTL, but complex-script line-breaking MAY NOT be accurate.</p>
<p>MultiCell() does not support kerning and justification. NB This includes &lt;textarea&gt; in forms which uses MultiCell() internally.</p>
<p>&lt;select&gt; form objects also do NOT support kerning.</p>
<h3>Page numbering</h3>
<p>Page numbering i.e. by including {PAGENO} or {â€Œnbpg} in a header/footer, can use any of the number types as used for list-style e.g.</p>
<p>&lt;pagebreak pagenumstyle="arabic-indic"&gt;</p>
<p>Short codes are recognised for the 5 most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>"1" - decimal</li>
<li>"A" = upper-latin or upper-alpha</li>
<li>"a" = lower-latin or lower-alpha</li>
<li>"I" = upper-roman</li>
<li>"i" = lower-roman</li>
</ul>
<p>or any of the following: arabic-indic, hebrew, bengali, devanagari, gujarati, gurmukhi, kannada, malayalam, oriya, persian, tamil, telugu, thai, urdu, cambodian, khmer, lao, cjk-decimal</p>
<p>Note: A suitable font must be used in the header/footer in order to display the numbers in the selected script.</p>
<p>You can now set the pagenumberstyle from the beginning of the document by changing the configurable variable:</p>
<p>$this-&gt;defaultPageNumStyle = "arabic-indic"; // in config.php

$mpdf-&gt;defaultPageNumStyle = "arabic-indic"; // at runtime</p>
<h3>Other Minor changes in mPDF 6</h3>
<p>'hebrew', 'khmer', 'cambodian', 'lao', and 'cjk-decimal' are recognised as values for "list-style-type" in numbered lists.</p>
<p>CSS "text-outline" is now supported on TD/TH tags</p>
<p>Text wrapping in tables has been improved when using CJK scripts (chinese-japanese-korean).</p>
<p>Text underline and strikethrough can be used together: <span>Hallo world</span>. Either &lt;u&gt;&lt;s&gt;...&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline line-through;"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; can be used</p>
<p>Added support for style="opacity:0.6;" in SVG - equivalent to: style="fill-opacity:0.6; stroke-opacity: 0.6;"</p>
<p>Added support for opacity="0.6" (as attribute) in SVG - previously only supported fill-opacity="0.6" stroke-opacity="0.6"</p>
<p>CSS position:absolute or fixed - rotate extended now to include rotate: 180; (previously just 90 or -90)</p>
<p>The default value of $this-&gt;keep_table_proportions = true; in config.php has been changed (see effect on Example 6 - nested table in top right cell).</p>
<p>Limited support has been added for SVG fonts embedded in SVG images (but not using @font-face rules) - see the separate Images demo file.</p>
<p>When using columns, the top margin is now collapsed at top of every column (not just first column of page).</p>
<p>The way mPDF handles optional end tags has been updated to be consistent with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#optional-tags">HTML5 specification</a> - previously not well defined for HTML4.</p>
<p>Changes to the way lists are handled means that text-align:justify may be inherited by lists from surrounding block elements (which did not happen previously). See LISTS above for more information.</p>
